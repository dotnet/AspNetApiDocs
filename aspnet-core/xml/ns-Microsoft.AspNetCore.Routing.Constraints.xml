    <summary>Provides types that are used to apply route constraints. Route constraints generally inspect the route value associated via the route template and make a true or false decision about whether the value is acceptable. Custom route constraints can be created by implementing <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.IRouteConstraint> and registering them with the app's <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.RouteOptions.ConstraintMap>.</summary>
